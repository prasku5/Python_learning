# Python OOP Concepts

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks covering various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. The notebooks are organized into categories such as Principles, Patterns, Encapsulation types, Core OOP Concepts, and Additional Concepts.

## Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Notebook**: [Single_Responsibility_Principle.ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Single_Responsibility_Principle.ipynb)
- **Description**: This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should only have one job or responsibility.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **Notebook**: [Open_Closed_Principle_(OCP).ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Open_Closed_Principle_(OCP).ipynb)
- **Description**: This principle states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Notebook**: [Liskov_Substitution_Principle_(LSP).ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Liskov_Substitution_Principle_(LSP).ipynb)
- **Description**: This principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the functionality.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **Notebook**: [Dependency_Inversion_Principle_(DIP).ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Dependency_Inversion_Principle_(DIP).ipynb)
- **Description**: This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

### Dependency Injection (DI) Principle
- **Notebook**: [Dependency_Injection_(DI)_principle.ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Dependency_Injection_Principle(DI).ipynb)
- **Description**: Dependency Injection is a technique where one object supplies the dependencies of another object.

## Patterns

### Factory Pattern
- **Notebook**: [Factory_pattern.ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Factory_pattern.ipynb)
- **Description**: The Factory pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.

### Singleton Pattern
- **Notebook**: [Singleton_pattern.ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Singleton_pattern.ipynb)
- **Description**: The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### Repository Pattern
- **Notebook**: [Repository_Pattern.ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Repository_Pattern.ipynb)
- **Description**: The Repository pattern mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection.

## Encapsulation

### Encapsulation (Private Attribute)
- **Notebook**: [Encapsulation_private_attribute.ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Encapsulation_private_attribute.ipynb)
- **Description**: Encapsulation using private attributes hides the internal state of an object and only allows access through public methods.

### Encapsulation (Protected Attribute)
- **Notebook**: [Encapsulation_protected_attribute.ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Encapsulation_protected_attribute.ipynb)
- **Description**: Encapsulation using protected attributes allows access within the same package or subclasses.

### Encapsulation (Public Attribute)
- **Notebook**: [Encapsulation_public_attribute.ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Encapsulation_public_attribute.ipynb)
- **Description**: Encapsulation using public attributes allows unrestricted access to the attribute.

## Core OOP Concepts

### Abstraction
- **Notebook**: [Abstraction.ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Abstraction.ipynb)
- **Description**: Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

### Inheritance
- **Notebook**: [Inheritance.ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Inheritance.ipynb)
- **Description**: Inheritance allows a new class to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class.

### Polymorphism
- **Notebook**: [Polymorphism.ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Polymorphism.ipynb)
- **Description**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, typically using methods to perform different tasks based on the object‚Äôs class.

### Object Composition
- **Notebook**: [Object_Composition.ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Object_Composition.ipynb)
- **Description**: Object Composition is a design principle where objects are composed of other objects to achieve functionality.

## Additional Concepts

### Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- **Notebook**: [Data_Transfer_Objects_(DTOs).ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Data_Transfer_Objects_(DTOs).ipynb)
- **Description**: DTOs are objects that carry data between processes to reduce the number of method calls.

### Decorators
- **Notebook**: [Decorators.ipynb](/Python_oops_concept/Decorators.ipynb)
- **Description**: Decorators are a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure.
