    "# Benefits of Singleton Pattern\n",
    "# Global Access Point:\n",
    "# The Singleton pattern provides a global access point to the instance. Any part of the application can access it without needing to pass it explicitly, which can be very convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Controlled Access:\n",
    "# The Singleton pattern controls the instantiation process. This ensures that only one instance is created, preventing accidental creation of multiple instances which could lead to inconsistent states.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lazy Initialization:\n",
    "# The instance is created only when it's needed for the first time, which can be useful for managing resources efficiently.\n",

    "# Decoupling:\n",
    "# Using a Singleton pattern decouples the usage of the instance from its creation. This can make the code cleaner and easier to maintain."
